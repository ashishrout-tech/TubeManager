## How It Works:
- **Create Projects**: Start by creating dedicated Workspaces for your YouTube videos. Each workspace serves as a container for all related content.

- **Add Videos**: Easily add videos to your workspaces and update their details, such as titles, thumbnails, and descriptions.

- **Collaborate**: Invite collaborators and assign roles to team members. You have full control over who can edit and manage your videos.

- **Deployment**: When your videos are ready for the world to see, deploy them to your YouTube channel directly from the app.
